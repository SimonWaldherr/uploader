## Introduction
This project attempts to achieve a user-friendly file-uploading experience over the web.
It's built as a Javascript plugin for developers looking to incorporate file-uploading into their website.

This plugin uses an XMLHttpRequest (AJAX) for uploading multiple files with a progress-bar in
FF3.6+, Safari4+, Chrome and falls back to hidden-iframe-based upload in other browsers (namely IE),
providing good user experience everywhere.

It does not use Flash, jQuery, or any other external libraries.  There is an optional jQuery plug-in that can be used to
integrate Fine Uploader into your project, but it is NOT required.  The same features are available with or without the
jQuery plug-in.

## Fine Uploader Has Two Modes...
You can use Fine Uploader in **FineUploader mode**, or in **FineUploaderBasic mode**.

### FineUploaderBasic mode
FineUploaderBasic mode is defined in the `qq.FineUploaderBasic` module in the code.  This is the base module for
Fine Uploader, and provides all functions that do not involve UI components.  Choose this mode if you need very tight
control over your uploader's UI.  If you choose this option, it is expected that you will provide all of your own UI, but
Fine Uploader will do the rest.

### FineUploader mode
FineUploader mode is defined in the `qq.FineUploader` module in the code.  It inherits everything from FineUploaderBasic,
plus it provides a customizable UI, including drag & drop, progress bars, status messages, a file list with color-coded status
indicators, and other UI niceties.  Most developers will likely opt to use FineUploader.

### jQuery plug-in
Fine Uploader also provides an optional jQuery plug-in.  This simply wraps the native uploader code.  You can use either of
the modes described above when using the jQuery plug-in via the `uploaderType` option.  More on the plug-in in the
[jQuery plug-in section](docs/using-jquery-plugin.md).

### Troubleshooting
If you can't get the uploader to work, please try the following steps
before asking for help.

If the upload doesn't complete, saying "failed":

* Set the `debug` option of the FineUploader to true.
* Open the page where you have a FineUploader.
* Open developer console in your browser.
* Try to upload the file. You should see a server response.

It should be `{"success":true}` for completed requests. If it's not,
then you have a problem with your server-side script.

If you are having other issues, please read [the FAQ section](docs/faq.md) before posting a question or bug.
